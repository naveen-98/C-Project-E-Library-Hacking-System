# C-Project-E-Library-Hacking-System
This is an e-library system created using the C language. But this is really a hacking system.

01 - To activate this program we must first enter the information of two. 
      (To register for the library )

02 - It then takes about 10 seconds for the information to enter the 
       program and be verified.( Automatically )

03 - It then automatically accesses the online library.

04 - Next, Requesting the user to provide an Internet connection.

05 - The user is then given 2 options.

06 - The first option is to give the user a command to select books. < 1 >

       +  Once the first option is selected, enter the required number of books 
           and then must enter the names of those books.
        
                 * You must then submit to the terms and conditions of this program 
                     before searching for relevant books.

                 * That is, you need to log in to your social media to verify the 
                    person who entered the program and to share the program among 
                    the people.
                               
                              = When the user agrees to it, the program sets the 
                                  environment that the user wants.
                                
                              = If the user is not sure about it, they can "download and read the terms" 
                                 if they want to know more about it in detail.



07 - The second option is a shortcut that goes directly to the library. < 2 > 
      ( Without selecting books )

       * Option 1 removes the book nomenclature and must agree to the terms as usual.



08 - After this, the user must enter the type of mobile phone used for authentication.
       ( Android or Apple )

09 - Once it is provided, the user will be automatically taken to the E- library

# E-Library Registration System

This project is a simple C-based console application for registering users to an E-Library system. It includes features for user registration, delay handling, time display, and user interaction through a text-based menu.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Collects first name and age for new users.
- **Delay Handling**: Implements a `setTimeout` function to introduce delays in the program.
- **Current Time Display**: Shows the current login time of the user.
- **Interactive Menu**: Offers options to download books or visit the library's website, and includes simple phishing and Trojan virus simulations for educational purposes.
- **System Messages**: Provides various system messages and ASCII art depending on user choices.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code**: Use a C compiler to compile the source code.
   ```bash
   gcc -o elibrary elibrary.c

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the compiled program.
   
   ./elibrary

3. **Follow the Prompts**: Enter the required information and follow the interactive menu to explore different functionalities.
